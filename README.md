# Modern tabulature writer on the web!

If you, like me, grew up using tools like TabIt to write out musical ideas - well, maybe you'll find some pleasure using this tool:

## What is it?

It's a tool for writing and playing music in TAB format! While currently lacking a lot of functionality, I hope you'll find it a convenient way to quickly note down musical themes and ideas. 

## Why this instead of {your midi writer}

Whatever you're currently using, it's probably more stable than this, and much more rich in functionality. However, Lingon is convenient and free.

## Why "Lingon"

They're tasty and the color reminds me of lingonberry jam.

## What's on the horizon?

This is mostly a preliminary roadmap. Expect it to change drastically over time:

- Multi-track songs
- Saving multiple songs locally
- Controlling volume and mastering
- Controlling EQ
- Track effects
  - Bending note
  - Changing volume
  - Changing instrument
  - Changing tempo
- Changing rythm and tempo
- More convenience shortcuts
  - insert / delete to shift track forwards and backwards
  - \+ / - to increase or decrease all notes in selection
  - page up / page down to shift notes up or down strings (keeping the same note if possible)
- Sharing functionality
- Cloud backups (tentative)
